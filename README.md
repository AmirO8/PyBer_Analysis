# Overview of the Analysis

  This new analysis is to show ride data from the months of January 2019 to April 2019. The data points were cities: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. To do this I had to get the total ride count from the three cities and along with the fare($) total. Once I calculated the totals, each city count can be divided by the totals.
  
# Results

  Before I go over the results I want to provide the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver, below is the chart.
 ![Figure 9 Total Sum](https://github.com/AmirO8/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Fig%209%20--%20Summary.png)
  We can see that Rural cities had a lower total fare that Suburban and Urban cities. One reason for the lower fares in Rural cities could be that they do not need rides as like people in Suburban and Urban cities. Urban cities were the highest, the reason for this can be people in Urban areas do not have vehicles to get around therefore there is a need for more rides. Rural cities peaked at the begining of April with $500 total fares. Suburban peak at around $1500 and Urban peaked twice at $2500. We can compare the peaks and see that Urban cities peak was 5 times higher than Rural and $1000 more than Suburban cities. Urban cities also had a higher price per ride this could be another reason why they only had 125 rides.
  The CEO could make rides cheaper for Urban cities through promotions and they could also increase the prices for Urban cities because they are going to pay for rides regardless. This will increase the average fair per ride.
